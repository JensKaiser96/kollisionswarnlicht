### PFLAU – Heartbeat, status, and basic alarms
"PFLAU,<RX>,<TX>,<GPS>,<Power>,<AlarmLevel>,<RelativeBearing>,<AlarmType>,<RelativeVertical>,<RelativeDistance>[,<ID>]"

RX              DEC [0 - 99]     -> Number  of  devices  with  unique  IDs  currently  received
TX              DEC [0 - 1]      -> Transmission status: 1 for OK and 0 for no transmission.
GPS             DEC [0 - 2]      -> GPS Status: 
                                    0 = no GPS reception,
                                    1 = 3d-fix on ground, i.e. not airborne,
                                    2 = 3d-fix when airborne 
Power           DEC [0 - 1]      -> Power status:
                                    1 = OK,
                                    0 = under/over voltage
AlarmLevel      DEC [0 - 3]      -> Alarm level as assessed by FLARM: 
                                    0 = no alarm, 
                                    1 = 13-18 seconds to impact, 
                                    2 = 9-12 seconds to impact, 
                                    3 = 0-8 seconds to impact
RelativeBearing DEC [-180 - 180] -> Relative bearing in degrees from true ground track to the 
                                    intruder’s  position. Positive  values  are  clockwise
AlarmType       HEX [00 - FF]    -> Type of alarm as assessed by FLARM, 
                                    0  =  no  aircraft  within  range  or  no-alarm  traffic information,
                                    2 = aircraft alarm

                                    A = FLARM sends status (requested and spontaneous)
Severity        DEC [0 - 3]      -> 0 = no error, i.e. normal operation. Disregard other 
                                        parameters. 
                                    1 = information only, i.e. normal operation,
                                    2 = functionality may be reduced,
                                    3 = fatal problem, device will not work 
ErrorCode       HEX [0 - FFF]    -> ...
